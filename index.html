    <p>Hi! I'm Max Najork - welcome to my homepage! I'm currently a fourth-year student at the <a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor, where I am studying Computer Science. This summer, I'm working at <a href="https://www.palantir.com/" target="_blank">Palantir Technologies</a> as a Performance Engineer Intern.</p>

    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>I'm a Bay Area native, born and raised in Palo Alto. True to the Silicon Valley stereotype, I received my first computer when I was seven - a used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOne" target="_blank">eMachines eOne</a> running Windows 98, purchased for a mere $100. With a modest 64 megabytes of RAM, it struggled to run the only program I installed on it: a visual programming suite that I used to bring my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms" target="_blank">LEGO Mindstorms</a> creations to life.</p>
    <p>I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto_High_School" target="_blank">Palo Alto High School</a> in 2012, and I expect to recieve my Bachelors of Science in Engineering from the University of Michigan in May 2016. I've spent the past two summers as an intern at Palantir, and am returning for a third stint this year. Prior to Palantir, I was an intern at the <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Lab</a> in Palo Alto, where my responsibilities included administrating an internal requirements tracking tool for the <a href="http://www.goes-r.gov/spacesegment/glm.html" target="_blank">Geostationary Lightning Mapper</a> project.</p>
    <p>I have experience with C++ and Java, and have worked with Xcode and Eclipse. I'm an avid learner, and enjoy picking up personal projects to explore new technologies.</p>
    <p>I hold dual citizenships with the United States and Germany.</p>

    <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking and backpacking - one of the more memorable adventures involved summiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta" target="_blank">Mount Shasta</a> in the summer of 2012. In addition to Shasta, I've traveled to Bryce Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion National Park.</p>
    <p>I'm an avid cook and I love experimenting with new recipes. <em property="italic">Bizarre Foods</em> with Andrew Zimmern and <em property="italic">No Reservations</em> with Anthony Bourdain are my TV shows of choice. I recently moved from a dilapidated basement room to an apartment with a real kitchen, and I'm excited to put it to use!</p>
    <p>I have too many favorite authors to enumerate them individually, but Sebastian Junger, Larry Niven, Terry Pratchett, Neal Stephenson, and Bill Watterson (sure, he's technically a cartoonist) are toward the top of the list.</p>
