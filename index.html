    <p>I'm Max Najork - welcome to my homepage! I'm currently a fourth-year student at the <a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor, where I am studying Computer Science. I'm returning to <a href="https://www.palantir.com/" target="_blank">Palantir Technologies</a> as a full-time employee post-graduation.</p>

    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>I'm a Bay Area native, born and raised in Palo Alto. I received my first computer when I was seven - a used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOne" target="_blank">eMachines eOne</a> running Windows 98.</p>
    <p>I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto_High_School" target="_blank">Palo Alto High School</a> in 2012, and I expect to receive my Bachelors of Science in Engineering from the University of Michigan in May 2016. I've spent the past three summers as an intern at Palantir. Prior to Palantir, I was an intern at the <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Lab</a> in Palo Alto.</p>
    <p>I have experience in C/C++ and Java, and I've dabbled in Python and JavaScript. I'm an avid learner - check out my <a href="https://github.com/najork" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> to see some of the things I've worked on.</p>
    <p>I hold dual citizenships with the United States and Germany.</p>

    <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I'm very interested in exploring machine learning, distributed systems, and computer security. I believe that all three areas are critical pillars in the future of computation.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about hiking and backpacking - I summited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta" target="_blank">Mount Shasta</a> in the summer of 2012. In addition, I've traveled to Bryce Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion National Park.</p>
    <p>I'm an active member of Michigan Interactive Investments, an undergraduate investment club in the Ross School of Business.</p>
